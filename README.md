# Note Taker

With this submission I attempted to create a note-taking app as outlined by the instructions, however I have run into several roadblocks and as time is running out I am pushing what I have completed thus far. My main issue appears to be making the routes and db folder "talk" to each other. I cannot figure out how to link the routes to make the buttons appear nor check if the notes are being saved. This will be for future development.
